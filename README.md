# Weather API web app

This was a new challenge where I learned a lot of things, the purpose of creating a second weather app was to create a better design and find a way to call several functions with a fetch.

- I succesfully created a better design developing a menu bar on the bottom part of the web app viewport, honestly I had to think for a while to get to this implementation.

- About the fetch calling several function, It took me some thinking but at the end I figured that I could use a master function and pass the API as an argument and then call all the functions inside the master function.
  The reasoning behind wanting to have individual functions for this web app was to better organize the code and have a improved structure since putting everything together would result in a super long function and hard to read structure.
